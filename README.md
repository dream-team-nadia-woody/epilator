## Detecting photosensitive epilepsy with Data Science

# Introduction
On December 16th, 1997, an episode of the wildly popular Pokémon anime had its premier broadcast in Japan. Roughly 20 minutes into the episode, titled "Dennō Senshi Porigon" (which roughly translates to "Cyber Soldier Porygon"), a sequence of flashing red and blue frames would cause huge problems for the show's many fans. In all, around 600-700 children required ambulances. While most recovered en route to the hospital, many more complained of headaches, eye strain, nausea and vomiting, and even, in rare cases, convulsions and even seizures. The event, later branded as "Pokémon Shock, would cause Nintendo's stock to drop 5%, the episode to be withdrawn from circulation, and legislation to be passed prohibiting such imagery from being broadcast in Japan, with similar legislation passing in the UK. While no similar legislation has been introduced in the United States, given the noteriety of the incident mentioned above, it seems highly unlikely that any companies would risk including such imagery.

However, in the age of user-generated content, those with photosensitivity or photosensitive epilepsy face an ever-growing pool of unregulated information. While tools do exist to help creators
