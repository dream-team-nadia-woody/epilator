    "Classes in Python (and most other Object-Oriented languages) can store data, and perform actions on that data. a `DataFrame` is one example. It both stores the data that you're exploring/modeling, and it can do things to that data, like get the mean, group the data, and render that data as HTML (that's why it looks so pretty in notebooks). Classes can be their own thing, or they can be a starting point for subclasses. [Here's a better explanation than I can give myself](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/inheritance)."
